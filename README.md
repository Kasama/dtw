Dynamic Time Warping
====================

The objective of this project is to implement a algorithm to classify temporal series using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm and data collected using accelerometers.

How to run
----------

To run this program you must have [Ruby][1] installed.

Open a terminal and run the following commands to clone the repository locally:
```bash
git clone http://github.com/Kasama/dtw
cd dtw
```

Once the repository is cloned you can run the simulations by typing
```
ruby main.rb
```
or
```
ruby main3d.rb
```
for the 1D and 3D simulations, respectively.

The simulation may take a while to execute, but a progress bar will be shown in order to provide status information
